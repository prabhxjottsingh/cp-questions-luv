Stacks is used in many ways for example:
-in finding NGE (next greater element)
-checking balanced Parenthesis

Queues is also used in many ways for example
-in graphs algorithms,
and many more, they are very important DS, with respect to CP

STACKS
LIFO - last in first out
we have access to things from the stack: top element, size of stack
operation - insertion(push), deletion(pop),  

QUEUES
FIFO - first in first out
operations - insertion (push(always at end)), deletion (pop(always from start)), front(to see element at first)
