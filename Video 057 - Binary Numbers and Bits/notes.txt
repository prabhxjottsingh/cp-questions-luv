important things to keep in mind:

-last bit of every odd number is 1 and that of every of even number is 0
-Basic Operation 
 -&(AND) => if one of the bit is zero then final ans will also be zero
 -^(OR) => if one of the bit is one then final ans will also be 1\
 -Left Shift (<<) => acts on binary
 -Rigth Shift (>>) => ((6>>1) = 3)

numbers are of 32 bits in int type
maximum number that can be produced using 4 bits = (2^4 - 1 )
