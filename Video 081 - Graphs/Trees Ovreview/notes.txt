Divided into 3 parts:

- Representation
- Traversal
- Algorithms

Representation:
-Matrix -> will just read about this only, not of much  use, just sometimes, when mentioned in question use it only
-List -> Used most of the times, will learn in deep about it (Vectors of vectors)

Traversal:
-BFS: Breadth First Search
-DFS: Depth First Search

Algorithms:
-Dijkstra (shortest distance if a single source from multiple sources)
-Bellman-Ford (shortest distance iof multiple sources from multiple sources)
                               <--Extra Topics-->
-Disjoint Set Union
-Minimum Spanning Tree
-Directed Acyclic Graph
-Topological Sort
