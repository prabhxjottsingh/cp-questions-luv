STL - Standard Template Library
Four parts:

1.Containers - Pre-emplemented DS in STL, 
 
 -Sequential DS:
  -Vectors
  -Stacks
  -Queue
  -Pair(not a container) (basically, a class in C++)

-Ordered DS:
 -Maps
 -Multi-Maps
 -Multiset

-Unordered DS:
 -Unordered Maps
 -Unordered Set

--Nested Containers:
  --vector<vector<int>>
  --map<int, vector<int>>
  --set<pair<int,string>>
  --vector<map<int,set<int>>>

2. Iterators - are basically similar to pointers, but they are specially implemented to point to the elements of the containers in STL 
               -points to memory address if container
               -begin(), end()
               -syntax to declare iterators: vector<itn>::iterator it;
               -continuity for containers

3. Algotrithms - (Very V.V. Important), pre-defined algorithms
                  -upper bound
                  -lower bound
                  -sort(comparator)
                  -max_element
                  -min_element
                  -accumulate
                  -reverse
                  -count
                  -find
                  -next_permutations
                  -prev_permutations, etc.,etc.,etc.

4. Functors - basically classes in C++, that can be used as a functions, (not much imp. for Competitive Coding, thus it is being skipped in this course)
