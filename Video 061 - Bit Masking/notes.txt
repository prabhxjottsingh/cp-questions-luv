//Bit-Masking

Say we have four fruits
map<string,int> mp = [{"orange", 0} {"apple", 1}, {"banana",2}, {"guava",3}];

person 1 -> 2,3   (1100)
person 2 -> 0,1,2 (0111)
person 3 -> 1,3   (1010)

we have to find common fruits between two people,

//basic method
find the intersection of the sets of every pair
we can find the intersection of two sorted arrays in O(N) times

//using bitmasks
bitmasks for:

person 1 -> 1100 (12) ( 2 and 3 bit is set as he has 2 and 3 fruit)
person 2 -> 0111 (7) (0, 1 and 2 bits are set for person 2)
person 3 -> 1010 (10) (1 and 3 bits are set for person 3)

now for finding common between two people we will take bitnasks and
and then count the number of set bits in the ans
