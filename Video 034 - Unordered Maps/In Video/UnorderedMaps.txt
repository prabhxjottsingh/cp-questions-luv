Unordered Maps are mostly similar to maps only, 

functions and other things are similar to ordered maps only,

follwoing are a little bit differences between ordered and unordered maps:
-in built implementations
-time complexity
-valid keys datatype

ordered maps use trees
whereas unordered maps use hash table

complex data structures like vector, pair, etc. cannot be used as keys in case of unordered maps,
but they can be used as key values in case of ordered maps
