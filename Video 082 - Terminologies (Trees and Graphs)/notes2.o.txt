if we can from one vertex to another and then from the that vertex come back to previous one, only then it is called a strongly connected component

graph is also called forest

directed graphs have some complex number of strongly connected components



root in tree:
child, parent, subtree, leaf node(nodes without chikd nodes)

depth of a node -> ditance of a nide from root node is called dept of tree
height: highest number if edges between root and leaf node
lca (lowest common ancestor) -> nearest common parent of two nodes
