vertex: circle type thing or we can simply say a point in graph is called vertex
edge: line joining two vertices

graph: collection of vertices and edges

edges can be bi-directional or uni-directional


a graph with out any cycle is called tree

cycle: 1->2->3->1 this is called a cycle
a graph without any cycle is called a tree

tree has n nodes, then number of edges = (n-1)

connected components -> if we can reach x point from y point then this is a single connected connected components
for example: 1-3-5-7-1 2-6 => here we have two connected components
 => 1-3-5-7-1-2-6 => here we have a single connected component

 untill now we have discussed undirected graphs only
